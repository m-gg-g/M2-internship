\section{Link with Percolation: two examples in $\Z^2$}
    % Imagine the following scenario for a percolation game: the state space is the square lattice $\Z^2$, and the collection of real-valued random variables $\{ \omega \mapsto g_{\omega}(z, i, j) \}_{(z, i, j) \in \Z^2 \times I \times J}$ are i.i.d. according to a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed parameter $p$ in $[0, 1]$, representing the payoff over the edges. This setup corresponds to the classic model of bond percolation. Alternatively, if the collection of random variables is $\{\omega \mapsto (g_{\omega}(z, i, j))_{(i, j) \in I \times J} \}_{z \in \Z^2}$, the payoff is over the sites, corresponding to the model of site percolation. The two examples that we present in this section are based on the former scenario. 

    % In this section, we study two examples in which players move a token along the vertices of the square lattice $\Z^2$, incurring a cost associated with each edge traversed, where edge costs are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. The primary difference between them is that in the first game, the token moves only once at each stage as a result of the combined actions of both players, while in the second game, the token moves twice --once for each player's action. 

    Percolation theory is well-known for its critical phenomena, particularly the existence of critical probability thresholds where large-scale connectivity emerges. In the games we analyze in this section, we explore how the critical thresholds for specific types of structures are crucial in determining the game's limit value and the optimal strategies for the players. A significant portion of the analysis presented in this section follows, or is inspired by, the work of Ziliotto in \cite{Ziliotto2023}.

    All the graphs presented were generated using the TikZ package and Python 3.

    % For the second game, for which there was no prior information about its value, we used computational methods to estimate it and observed surprising behavior that we began to address theoretically.

	\subsection{Game 1} 
    	Consider a percolation game with state space $\Z_r^2$, which, as stated in the notations subsection, is $\Z^2$ rotated $45^\circ$. The actions sets are $I = J = \{+1, -1\}$, and for each $(z, i, j) \in \Z_r^2 \times I \times J$, the payoff random variables $\{\omega \mapsto g_{\omega}(z, i, j)\}$ are i.i.d. according to a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p \in [0, 1]$. The transition function is given by $q(i, j) = \frac{(j, i)}{\sqrt{2}}$ for all $(i, j) \in I \times J$. Thus, player 2's action determines the change in the abscissa of the state (right if $+1$ and left if $-1$), while player 1's action determines the change in the ordinate (top if $+1$ and bottom if $-1$). 

        To ensure consistent payoffs on the same edge, we require that $g_{\omega}(z, i, j) = g_{\omega}(z + (j, i), -i, -j)$ for all $(\omega, z, i, j) \in \Omega \times \Z_r^2 \times I \times J$. With this setting, the game is a non-i.i.d. percolation game, though with very weak correlations.

        In this game, the payoffs are interpreted as costs on the edges. For simplicity, we will treat the payoff function as the collection of random variables $\{c(e)\}_{e \in \E_r^2}$ and refer to these as the costs. 

    	\begin{remark} 
    		Considering the rotated lattice has no mathematical significance; it is merely a matter of convenience for our purpose.

            \caption{For Game 1, a realization of the payoff function for $p = 0.4$ (edges with a cost of 1 are represented by \protect\costOne and edges with 0 cost by \protect\costZero) along with the corresponding $1$-stage game (in red) starting from 0. The token is the black dot.}
        \end{figure}

    	Let $p$ be fixed, $\omega \in \Omega$ also, and consider a token placed at a given initial state $z \in \Z_r^2$. The game proceeds as follows: At each stage $m \in \N_+$, player 1 chooses top or bottom, then, knowing player 1's action, player 2 chooses left or right. The token then moves from its current state to the next, according to the combination of both actions: top-right, top-left, bottom-right or bottom-left. Player 1 then pays player 2 the cost associated with the corresponding edge. Thus, player 1 aims to minimize the payoff, while player 2 aims to maximize it.
        
        For $m \in \N_+$, we denote by $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m$ the path formed by the edges traversed in the game up to stage $m$. Since players can move the token in any of the four directions, the game is non-oriented; the path can loop back, intersect itself, and even form an infinite loop.

        A strategy for player 1 is a collection of mappings $(\sigma_m)_{m \geq 1}$, where each $\sigma_m$ assigns an action from the set $I$ to every possible history $(z, e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m)$. For player 2, the strategy is the collection of mappings $(\tau_m)_{m \geq 1}$, where each $\tau_m$  assigns an action in the set $J$ to every possible sequence $(z, e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m, i_m)$.

        For the $n$-stage game, the total payoff and value are
        \[
        	\gamma_n(z, \sigma, \tau) := \frac{1}{n}\sum_{m = 1}^{n}c(e_m) \; \text{ and } \; v_n(z) := \min_{\sigma \in \Sigma}\max_{\tau \in T} \gamma_n(z, \sigma, \tau) = \max_{\tau \in T}\min_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \gamma_n(z, \sigma, \tau).
        \]

        The total payoff of the game is defined as the limit superior of the average payoff:
        \[
        	\gamma(z, \sigma, \tau) := \limsup_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{m = 1}^{n}c(e_m).
        \]
        
        \begin{remark}
            In this context, the limit superior criterion is used to aggregate the payoff because it always exists within $\bar{\R}$, ensuring that it is a well-defined mathematical object. In contrast, the standard limit may not always exist. By using the $\limsup$ criterion, the outcome of the game is interpreted as the biggest possible long-term mean payoff achievable. In our scenario, where player 1 aims to minimize (and player 2 aims to maximize), this choice could be seen as disadvantageous for player 1 (and advantageous for player 2).
            %The choice between $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ is largely a matter of preference and should be guided by the needs of the specific model being analyzed. 
        \end{remark}

        Defined in this way, by Martin's theorem \cite{Martin1998}, the game has a value, which is
        \[
            v_p(z) := \min_{\sigma \in \Sigma}\max_{\tau \in T} \gamma(z, \sigma, \tau) = \max_{\tau \in T}\min_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \gamma(z, \sigma, \tau).
        \]

        Can we say something about $v_p(z)$? Does it depends on $z$? Is it random? Regarding these questions, we have the following result, presented by Ziliotto in \cite{Ziliotto2023}.

        \begin{theorem}\label{theorem-vz-independent-z-game1}
            $v_p(z)$ is independent of $z$ and is almost surely deterministic. 
        \end{theorem}

        The proof of this result primarily relies on game-theoretic arguments, which involves analyzing paths generated by both optimal and suboptimal strategies. Subsequently, a 0-1 law argument establishes that $v_p$ is deterministic. This will be further clarified in the next subsection, where we discuss the same result for the second game example.

        In the sequel, the limit value will be denoted simply by $v_p$.

        \begin{remark}\label{remark_v_p_non_decreasing}
           Note that the function $p \mapsto v_p$ is non-decreasing. This follows from the result stating that the parametrized family of probability measures $\{\Pbb_p\}_{p \in [0, 1]}$ can be coupled in an increasing way (see, for example, Proposition 2.1. in \cite{DuminilCopin2018}). 
        \end{remark}

        Given that $v_p$ is constant (taking values in $[0, 1]$), a natural question is: how much is it? In his presentation, Ziliotto further proved that it equals 1 if and only if $p$ is greater or equal than the probability threshold of oriented bond percolation. 

        Let $V$ be the event: ``there exists an infinite, vertically oriented path composed of 1s''. We call these paths 1-vertical. According to percolation theory (Theorem 3.30 in \cite{Grimmett2018}), there exists a \emph{critical probability} $p_1 \in (0, 1)$, such that:
        \begin{equation}\label{percolation-probability-1-vertical}
                \quad \Pbb_p(V) = \begin{cases}
                                    1       & p > p_1,\\  
                                    0       & p < p_1.
                                \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        The function $\Pbb_p(V)$ (as a function of $p$) is called \emph{percolation probability}. The result is:

        \begin{theorem} \label{theorem-v1-p1}
            The value $v_p$ is 1 if and only if $p \geq p_1$. 
        \end{theorem}

        Building on the ideas from his presentation, we provide a non-rigorous sketch of the proof for this theorem, as certain aspects are essential for analyzing the value in both game examples.

        Due to the significance in our analysis of lattice structures that confer strategic advantages to players, we provide the following definition:

        \begin{definition}\label{def-right-structure-game1}
            An infinite subgraph $C$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, of the lattice $\Z_r^2$ is said to be a winning structure for player 1 if, for all $z \in V$, there exists an $i \in I$ such that, for all $j \in J$, $z + q(i, j) \in V$ and $\{z, z + q(i, j)\} \in E$. Similarly, is said to be a winning structure for player 2 if, for all $z \in V$, there exists a $j\in J$ such that, for all $i \in I$, $z + q(i, j) \in V$ and $\{z, z + q(i, j)\}$ is in $E$.
        \end{definition}

        Intuitively, these structures correspond to paths in the lattice where one player can capture the other, meaning they can keep the token within the structure regardless of the other player's actions. Note that this definition is independent of the edge costs.

                    and player 1 plays top, then player 2 will respond with right. Conversely, if player 1 plays bottom, player 2 will respond with left. A similar analysis can be done to any other vertex of the red path.}

                % At the point immediately preceding this one in the black path, player 2 will play $\shortarrow{0}$ regardless of player 1's action. 
                \label{figure-1-vertical}
        \end{figure} 

        Assume $p > p_1$. By \eqref{percolation-probability-1-vertical} and the corresponding reference, there exists a 1-vertical path with probability 1. Since this path is a winning structure for player 2 (see Figure \ref{figure-1-vertical}) and all edge costs along it are equal to 1, player 2 guarantees a value of 1. This proves that $v_p =  1$ in the supercritical regime. 

        The critical regime $p = p_1$ is more delicate. A 1-vertical path is no longer present. However, even in the absence of a 1-vertical path, it is still possible to devise a strategy for player 2 that moves through vertical oriented paths filled with 1s of increasing lengths, in such a way that he ensures a value of 1. To achieve this, the following result from Duminil-Copin et al. \cite{DuminilCopin18} is crucial. 
        % It provides an estimate on the probability of being within a distance $O(n)$ of a vertically oriented path filled with 1s of length $n$.

        \begin{proposition}\label{duminil-copin}
            There exists $\beta > 0$ such that for all $n$, the probability that there exists a vertically oriented path filled with 1s, of length greater than or equal to $n$, with its center at a distance less than or equal to $n^{1-\beta}$, is at least $1 - \exp(-n^{\beta})$. 
        \end{proposition} 
        
        For the $\beta$ of Proposition \ref{duminil-copin}, let $V_n$ be the event: ``there exists a vertically oriented path, with length greater than or equal to $n$ and composed of 1s, such that its center is at a distance less than or equal to $n^{1-\beta}$''. We denote by $1_n$-vertical a vertically oriented path of length at least $n$. 

        This proposition intuitively states that a $1_n$-vertical path with $n$ large enough occurs with high probability, in such a way that if you want to reach it, you don't have to wait too long. For player 2, reaching a $1_n$-vertical path may require sacrificing $n^{1-\beta}$ times 1, but this number is sublinear compared to the linear number of 1s that he will gain in the $1_n$-vertical path. 

        Based on this, for $n$ large enough, player 2 should aim to reach a $1_n$-vertical path and then stay in it for as long as possible. This approach is referred to as the $n$-strategy of player 2. If player 2 is smart he will stay for $n$ stages, but thereafter, he will not start with $n$ again. Instead, he will look for a path of length greater or equal than $n+1$, then greater or equal than $n+2$, and so on. 

        Let $N \geq 1$. At the stage $n \geq N$, the strategy for player 2 is: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[--] Play the $n$-strategy until leaving the path.
            \item[--] Then, search a $1_{n + 1}$-vertical path.
        \end{itemize}

        With this strategy, the only negative outcome to player 2 would be failing to find a sequence of paths $(1_n\text{-vertical})_{n \geq N}$. However, the probability of finding this sequence is given by
        \begin{eqnarray} \notag
            \Pbb_p\left(\bigcap_{n \geq N}V_n\right) & = & 1 - \Pbb_p\left(\exists n \geq N : V_n \text{ does not happen}\right) \\ \notag
            & \geq & 1 - \sum_{n \geq N} \Pbb_p(V_n^c)  \geq 1 - \sum_{n \geq N} \exp(-n^{\beta}), 
        \end{eqnarray}
        % \begin{eqnarray} \notag
        %     \Pbb_p\left(\bigcap_{n \geq N}V_n\right) & = & 1 - \Pbb_p\left(\exists n \geq N : V_n \text{ does not happen}\right) \\ \notag
        %     & \geq & 1 - \sum_{n \geq N} \Pbb_p(V_n^c) \\ \notag
        %     & \geq & 1 - \sum_{n \geq N} \exp(-n^{\beta}), 
        % \end{eqnarray}
        where the first inequality follows from the union bound, and the final result comes from Proposition \ref{duminil-copin}, which states that $\Pbb_p(V_n) > 1 - \exp(-n^{\beta})$. As $N$ tends to infinity, this probability tends to 1. 

        From this, it follows that with positive probability, player 2 can guarantee a value of 1. Therefore, with positive probability, the value is 1. Since $v_p$ is deterministic, it follows that $v_p =  1$. 

        Avelio Sepúlveda and Bruno Ziliotto are currently working on a paper that addresses the link between this game and oriented bond percolation in $\Z^2$. In the subcritical regime, they have demonstrated that player 1 guarantees a value strictly smaller than 1, thereby completing the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-v1-p1}. They achieve this by considering a strategy for player 1 in which he always plays top, and by showing that the path followed by the token under this strategy has a positive density of 0s because it is oriented. They also established that the map $p \mapsto v_p$ is continuous at $p_1$. 

        Additionally, they have a result indicating that for $p$ sufficiently small, player 1 can achieve a value of 0. This result cannot be inferred from the previous analysis due to the lack of symmetry in the game. In the following, we outline our approach to better understand the conditions under which the value is 0.

        We start by identifying the winning structures for player 1. To do this, we examine all possible local configurations around a vertex. This approach yields a geometric characterization of such structures.

        First, why are infinite vertically oriented paths the winning structures for player 2? Geometrically, it is easily observed that in a winning structure for player 2, locally around each vertex, the edges must take one of the following four configurations (see Figure \ref{figure-1-vertical}):

        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt] 
                \draw[color=black!100] (-0.5, 0) circle (2pt);

            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
       \noindent Configurations that do not guarantee this are:
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt] 
                \draw[color=black!100] (-1., -1) circle (2pt);
                \draw[color = black!100] (-1.5, -1.5) -- (-1, -1);

                \draw[color = black!100] (0.5, -1.5) -- (1, -1);
            \end{tikzpicture},
            where player 1 always has an option to escape from the path. This confirms the verticality of the structure. In contrast, structures with these local forms are controlled by player 1 and we state this as a proposition.

       \begin{proposition} \label{rigtht-structure-player1-game1}

       A finite portion of these structures could take on a seemingly intricate form:

       \input{game1-player1-structure}

       In the following, we refer to winning structures for player 1 that are filled with $0$s, as $0$-horizontal structures, and denote the event: ``there exists a $0$-horizontal structure'' by $H_0$. The percolation probability for these structures is $\Pbb_p(H_0)$ and the critical probability $p_0$ is defined as
        \[
            p_0 := \sup\{ p \in [0, 1] : \Pbb_p(H_0) = 1\}.
        \]     

        \begin{theorem}\label{conjecture-v0-p0}
            For all $p < p_0$, $v_p = 0$.
        \end{theorem}
        
        \begin{proof}
            If $p < p_0$, a $0$-horizontal structure appears. Player 1 can reach such a structure in a finite number of stages. Since this structure is a winning one for player 1, it guarantees a value of $0$. Therefore, $v_p =  0$.

        \end{proof}

        Is fundamental to establish that $0 < p_0 < 1$. We state this as a theorem:

        \begin{theorem}\label{theorem-p_0}
            $0 < p_0 < 1$.
        \end{theorem}

        % We could not find any references or studies addressing percolation for these types of structures; therefore, we provide a proof for this result.

        \begin{proof}
           Let denote by $A$ the event: ``there exists a 0-horizontal structure composed entirely by squares'', and let $B$ be the event: ``there exists an horizontally oriented path filled with 0s''. We have the following relation between these events and $H_0$:
           \begin{equation}\label{A-H_0-B}
                A \subset H_0 \subset B.
           \end{equation}

           The inclusion $A \subset H_0$ is because any 0-horizontal structure composed entirely of squares is itself a 0-horizontal structure. The inclusion $H_0 \subset B$ is more subtle; it follows from the geometric local characterization of the vertices in a 0-horizontal structure. To see why this is the case, imagine traversing a 0-horizontal structure from left to right. At each vertex, you have one of the two possibilities: moving top-right 
           \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt] 
                \draw[color=black!100] (0.5, -1.5) circle (2pt); 
                \draw[color = black!100] (0.5, -1.5) -- (1, -1);
            \end{tikzpicture}, or moving bottom-right 
           \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt] 
                \draw[color=black!100] (-1., -1) circle (2pt);
                \draw[color = black!100] (-0.5, -1.5) -- (-1, -1);
           \end{tikzpicture}. By consistently choosing one of these options at each vertex, you will end up with an infinite, horizontally oriented path filled with 0s.

           As mentioned earlier (see \eqref{percolation-probability-1-vertical}), percolation theory tells us that the critical probability for $B$ is $1 - p_1 < 1$. Therefore, using the second relation in \eqref{A-H_0-B}, we obtain $p_0 \leq 1-p_1 < 1$. 

           It remains to be shown that $p_0 > 0$. 

           Define the critical probability of the event $A$ as 
           $$
                p^* := \sup\{p \in [0, 1] : \Pbb_p(A) = 1\}.
           $$ 
           From the first relation in \eqref{A-H_0-B}, we have $p^* < p_0$. Thus, it suffices to prove that $p^* > 0$. 

           To do this, we use a Peierls-type argument. This argument focuses on contour-like structures or boundaries between regions with different configurations. In percolation theory, a key component is the use of the \emph{dual} lattice to analyze these boundaries; contours in the original lattice can be mapped onto paths or circuits in the dual lattice..

            % The Peierls argument, originally developed by physicist Rudolf Peierls for the 2D Ising model, is a powerful technique in statistical mechanics and percolation theory for establishing bounds on critical parameters and demonstrating the existence of phase transitions, particularly in low-dimensional systems. This argument focuses on contour-like structures or boundaries between regions with different configurations. A key component is the use of the \emph{dual} lattice to analyze these boundaries; contours in the original lattice can be mapped onto paths or circuits in the dual lattice. This approach can simplify complex random geometric problems into more manageable combinatorial ones.
            % It demonstrates that below a certain critical temperature or probability, the system transitions from a disordered phase to an ordered one, or in percolation theory, from small clusters to the formation of an infinite cluster.
            % The Peierls argument has been adapted and generalized for various models and dimensions, making it a versatile tool for understanding phase transitions across different systems.

            Consider the dual lattice $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_r^2$, which is a copy of our original square lattice translated by the vector $(0, 1/2)$. Define a 1-1 mapping where $e \in \E_r^2$ and $\tilde{e} \in \tilde{\mathbb{E}}_r^2$ are said to be \emph{dual to each other} if $\tilde{e}$ crosses $e$. Using the original random variables $\{c(e)\}_{e \in \E_r^2}$, we define random variables for the dual edges $\{\tilde{c}(\tilde{e})\}_{\tilde{e} \in \tilde{\mathbb{E}}_r^2}$ by setting $\tilde{c}(\tilde{e}) = 1 - c(e)$. Note that the distribution of $\tilde{c}$ is a translation by $(0, 1/2)$ of the distribution $\Pbb_{1-p}$.
 
            In what follows, we refer to a 0-square as a square with all its edges equal to 0. The length of a structure will be understood as the number of squares it contains and the distance between two squares is understood as the distance between their centers.
            
            If there is no 0-horizontal structure composed entirely of 0-squares, then the origin cannot be contained within one. From the duality relation, it follows that if there is no 0-horizontal structure composed entirely of 0-squares containing the origin, there must exist an $n \in \N_+$ such that the square $[-n, n] \times [-n, n]$ is crossed vertically by a dual path that does not contain 0-squares. A dual path can be interpreted as another different structure. 

           From all this, using the union bound, Markov inequality and the fact that a dual path from $[-n, n] \times \{n\}$ to $[-n, n] \times \{-n\}$ must have at least $2n$ edges, we obtain
           \begin{eqnarray} \notag
                \Pbb_p(A^c) & \leq & \sum_{n \geq 1} \Pbb_p\left(\substack{\text{there exist a dual path that does not contain} \\ \text{0-squares, from } [-n, n] \times \{n\} \text{ to } [-n, n] \times \{-n\}}\right) \\ \notag
                            & \leq & \sum_{n \geq 1} \E_p\left(\substack{\text{number of dual paths that does not contain} \\ \text{0-squares, from } [-n, n] \times \{n\} \text{ to } [-n, n] \times \{-n\}}\right) \\ \notag
                            & \leq & \sum_{n \geq 1} \sum_{l \geq 2n} \kappa(l) \Pbb_p\left(\substack{\text{all squares of a given dual path} \\ \text{of length $l$ are not  0-squares}}\right),
           \end{eqnarray}   
           where $\kappa(l) = \#\{\text{of dual paths from } [-n, n] \times \{-n\} \text{ to } [-n, n] \times \{n\} \text{ of length } l\}$.

           Let each square (of any of the lattices considered) be associated with its center, and define the center of a square to be open if and only if the square is a 0-square. With this definition, the problem of finding a path in this percolation setting --where paths are composed of squares with edges that can be either open or closed-- translates into finding a path in a 1-dependent site percolation model. In this model, for any $k \geq 2$ and any sites $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k \in \Z^2$ that are at a distance of at least 2 (i.e., they are not immediate neighbors), the random variables indicating whether each site is open are independent.

           Let $\tilde{\alpha}$ be the given oriented dual path of length $l$. For any square in $\tilde{\alpha}$ at most 5 squares of $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}^2$ are within a distance of 1 from it. Hence, there exists a sub-path $\tilde{\beta}$ of at least $l/5$ squares of $\tilde{\alpha}$ such that any two squares $x, y \in \tilde{\beta}$ are at a distance of at least $2$. Between these paths $\tilde{\alpha}$ and $\tilde{\beta}$ we have the following relation, 
           $$
                \Pbb_p(\text{every square in } \tilde{\alpha} \text{ is not a 0-square}) \leq \Pbb_p(\text{every square in } \tilde{\beta} \text{ is not a 0-square}).
           $$ 
           Moreover, since the costs of the squares of $\tilde{\beta}$ are independent, we get
           \[
                \Pbb_p(\text{every square in } \tilde{\alpha} \text{ is not a 0-square}) \leq (1 - (1-p)^4)^{|\tilde{\beta}|} \leq (1 - (1-p)^4)^{l/5}. 
           \]

           For $\kappa(l)$, the following upper bound can be given:
           \[
                \kappa(l) \leq (2n)^25^l,
           \]
           where $(2n)^2$ accounts for the number of possible starting and ending squares of the path, and $5^l$ represents the number of possible ways to complete the path, considering the choices for each square within a distance smaller than 2.

           Consequently, 
           \[
                \Pbb_p(A^c) \leq 4 \sum_{n \geq 1} n^2 \sum_{l \geq 2n} 5^l(1 - (1-p)^4))^{l/5} \to 0, \text{ as } p \to 0.
           \]
           Hence, by choosing $p$ small enough such that
           \[
                \Pbb_p(A^c) < 1,
           \]
           we obtain $\Pbb_p(A) > 0$. Since the event $A$ is translation invariant and $\Pbb_p$ is ergodic (see Lemma 2.8 in \cite{DuminilCopin2018}), its probability must be either 0 or 1. Therefore, for sufficiently small $p$, $\Pbb_p(A) = 1$, implying $p^* > 0$.

        \end{proof}
        
        % Let denote by $\Psi(p)$ the probability that there exists \text{some} winning structure for player 1, not necessarily containing the origin. Obviously $\Psi(p) \geq \psi(p)$ and thus $\Psi(p) > 0$ for $p > p_0$. One can show more. In fact, we have the following zero-one law $\Psi(p)$: 
        % \[
        %     \Psi(p) = \begin{cases}
        %                              0      & p < p_0, \\  
        %                              1      & p > p_0.
        %                \end{cases}
        % \]
        
        Note that the only winning structure for player 1 that does not include squares is the infinite concatenation of one of the two local configurations, specifically, the path:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt]
                \def\aa{-20}
                \def\bb{10}
                    \foreach \x in {\aa, ..., \bb} {
                        \draw[color = black!100] (\x, 0) -- (\x + 0.5, 0.5);
                        \draw[color = black!100] (\x + 0.5, 0.5) -- (\x + 1, 0.0);
                    }
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}

        \noindent However, the probability of having a path like this with $L$ edges and all edge costs equal 0 is $(1 - p)^L$. Therefore,
        \[
            \Pbb_p(\ldots \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt]
                    \def\aa{-5}

                        }
                \end{tikzpicture} \ldots) = \lim_{L \to \infty} (1 - p)^L = \begin{cases}
                                                                            1   &   p = 0, \\
                                                                            0   &   p > 0. 
                                                                        \end{cases}
       \]
       This means that the critical probability threshold for this structure is 0, indicating that there is no phase transition for it. Aside from this case, all 0-horizontal structures strictly contain an infinite, horizontally oriented path (see the analysis used to prove the second inclusion in \eqref{A-H_0-B}). Therefore, the following result follows:

        \begin{proposition} \label{theorem-relation-p0-p1}
            $p_0 < 1-p_1$.

        Motivated by Theorem \ref{theorem-v1-p1}, we propose the following conjecture:

        \begin{conjecture}\label{conjecture-v0-p0}
            The value $v_p$ is 0 if and only if $p \leq p_0$.
        \end{conjecture}

        For proving this result in the critical regime $p = p_0$, a result similar to Proposition \ref{duminil-copin} would be needed, but for 0-horizontal structures. However, we have not found any references to this type of structure in the literature, and proving this is not straightforward. Nevertheless, we would very much like to attempt this, so it remains a task for future work. Similarly, proving that if $p > p_0$, then $v_p > 0$ should be feasible --following the idea of Bruno and Avelio-- by considering a strategy for player 2 where he always plays right, regardless of player 1's actions, and then demonstrating that the path followed by the token under this strategy has a positive density of 1s. Thus, with this strategy, player 2 guarantees a value strictly greater than 0.

        In the following, we introduce the second percolation game, whose analysis similarly revolves on identifying the winning structures for each player.

    \subsection{Game 2}     
        This game has the same state space and action sets as the previous game, but without rotating the square lattice $\Z^2$. 

        At each stage $m \in \N_+$, there are 2 substages:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item[--] player 1 chooses an action $i_m$, and the state moves to $z_{m+1/2} = z_m + (0, i_m)$.
                \item[--] Then, knowing player 1's action, player 2 chooses an action $j_m$, and the token moves to $z_{m+1} = z_{m+1/2} + (j_m, 0) = z_m + (j_m, i_m)$.
        \end{itemize}
        The payoff for the $m$-stage game is given by $g_m^{\omega} := g_{\omega}(z_{m}, i_m, 0) + g_{\omega}(z_{m+1/2}, 0, j_m)$. Player 1 receives $g_m^{\omega}$ , while player 2 receives $-g_m^{\omega}$. Note that, unlike the previous game, the token moves twice at each stage. However, the transition function remains the same. This time, player 1 maximizes.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{../images/game2/L5grid_arrowsit0p040.png}

            \caption{For Game 2, a realization of the payoff function for $p = 0.4$ along with the corresponding $1$-stage and 2-stage games starting from 0.}
        \end{figure}

        In essence, at each stage, player 1 moves the token up or down, then, knowing player 1's action, player 2 moves the token left or right, and both players receive the payoff associated with the edges traversed by the token.

        To ensure consistent payoffs on the same edge, we require that $g_{\omega}(z, i, 0) = g_{\omega}(z + (0, i), -i, 0)$ and $g_{\omega}(z, 0, j) = g_{\omega}(z + (j, 0), 0, -j)$ for all $(\omega, z, i, j) \in \Omega \times \Z^2 \times I \times J$. With this setting, the game is, like Game 1, a non-i.i.d. percolation game with very weak correlations. Of course, this game is non-oriented as well. 

        This time, for $m \in \N_+$, the path followed by the token up to stage $m$ has $2m$ edges:  $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{2m}$. As in the other game, we denote by $\{c(e)\}_{e \in \E^2}$ the random costs determined by the random payoff function and the strategies are defined in the same way. 

        For the $n$-stage game, the payoff function and the value function are
        \[
           \gamma_n(z, \sigma, \tau) := \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{m = 1}^{2n}c(e_m) \; \text{ and } \; v_n(z) := \max_{\sigma \in \Sigma}\min_{\tau \in T} \gamma_n(z, \sigma, \tau) = \min_{\tau \in T}\max_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \gamma_n(z, \sigma, \tau).
        \]

        The total payoff of the game is defined as well using the limit superior:
        \begin{equation}\label{payoff-game1}
            \gamma(z, \sigma, \tau) := \limsup_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{2n}\sum_{m = 1}^{2n}c(e_m),
        \end{equation}
        and again by Martin's theorem the game has a value, equal to
        \[
            v_p(z) := \max_{\sigma \in \Sigma}\min_{\tau \in T} \gamma(z, \sigma, \tau) = \min_{\tau \in T}\max_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \gamma(z, \sigma, \tau).
        \]

        \input{game2-value-independence-from-the-initial-state-and-...}

        Similar to Game 1, we define winning structures for both players.

        \begin{definition}\label{def-right-structure-game2}
            A infinite subgraph $C = (V, E)$ of the lattice $\Z^2$ is said to be a winning structure for player 1 if, for all $z \in V$, there exists an $i \in I$ such that, for all $j \in J$, the vertices $z + (0, i)$ and $z + (j, i)$ are in $V$,  and the edges $\{z, z + (0, i)\}$, and $\{z + (0, i), z + (j, i)\}$ are in $E$. Similarly, a graph is said to be a winning structure for player 2 if, for all $z \in V$, there exists an $j \in J$ such that, for all $i \in I$,  $z + (j, 0)$ and $z + (j, i)$ are in $V$, and $\{z, z + (j, 0)\}$ and $\{z + (j, 0), z + (j, i)\}$ are in $E$.
        \end{definition}

        From the Definition \ref{def-right-structure-game2} it easily follows that:
        \begin{proposition}\label{rigtht-structure-player1-game2}
            A structure $C$ is a winning one for player 1 if and only if, from any of it vertices, at least one of the following local configurations is present: 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline, yshift=0.5ex, scale=0.5pt] 
                    \draw[color=black!100] (0, 0) circle (2pt);
                    \draw[color = black!100] (0, 0) -- (0, -1);
                    \draw[color = black!100] (0, -1) -- (1, -1);
                    \draw[color = black!100] (0, -1) -- (-1, -1);

                    \draw[color=black!100] (2, -1) circle (2pt);
                    \draw[color = black!100] (2, 0) -- (2, -1);
                    \draw[color = black!100] (2, 0) -- (3, 0);
                    \draw[color = black!100] (2, 0) -- (1, 0);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
       \noindent Similarly, for player 2 a structure $C$ is a winning one if, from any of it vertices, at least one of the following local configurations is present:
       \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5pt] 
                \draw[color=black!100] (0, 0) circle (2pt);
                \draw[color = black!100] (0, 0) -- (1, 0);
                \draw[color = black!100] (1, 0) -- (1, 1);
                \draw[color = black!100] (1, 0) -- (1, -1);

                \draw[color=black!100] (-1, 0) circle (2pt);
                \draw[color = black!100] (-1, 0) -- (-2, 0);
                \draw[color = black!100] (-2, 0) -- (-2, 1);
                \draw[color = black!100] (-2, 0) -- (-2, -1);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        \end{proposition}

        \input{game2-player1-structure}

        By the previous proposition, a possible portion of a winning structure for player 2 will resemble the one shown in Figure \ref{fig_portion_winning_structure_player1_game2}, but oriented vertically rather than horizontally. Thus, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between each winning structure for player 1 and a corresponding winning structure for player 2 by simply reversing the orientation of the winning structures (which can be viewed as rotating it by 90 degrees).

        \begin{remark}\label{remark_structures_restricted_game2}
            Winning structures for player 1 do not necessarily have to be in the form described in Figure \ref{fig_portion_winning_structure_player1_game2}. They consist of horizontal bands, by which we mean horizontal paths of contiguous squares, but these bands can be arranged one above the other in different ways. For example, a possible portion could be:
           \input{game2-player1-structure-remark}
        \end{remark}

        Let us define 41-horizontal structures as winning structures for player 1, filled with 1s. Denote by $H_{41}$ the event of its existence and define its critical probability as
        \[
            q_1 := \inf \{p \in [0, 1] : \Pbb_p(H_{41}) = 1\}.
        \]
        Similarly, we define 40-vertical structures as winning structures for player 2, filled with 0s, with $V_{40}$ denoting the event of its existence and $q_0$ representing its critical probability.

       The subscripts should be understood to indicate structures that contain 4 ones and 4 zeros, respectively. In the next subsection, a more general definition will be provided, which will clarify the reasoning behind these designations.
       
        \begin{theorem}\label{theorem-v0-q0-v1-q1}
            For all $p > q_1$, $v_p = 1$ and for all $p < q_0$, $v_p = 0$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $p > q_1$, a $41$-horizontal (or if $p < q_0$, a $40$-vertical) structure appears. Player 1 (or player 2) can reach such a structure in a finite number of stages. Since this structure is a winning one for player 1 (or player 2), it guarantees a value of $1$ (or 0). Therefore, $v_p =  0$ for $p < q_0$ and $v_p =  1$ for $p > q_1$. 

        \end{proof}

       By the previously mentioned one-to-one correspondence between structures, we have:
       \begin{proposition}\label{proposition-relation-q0-q1}
            $q_0 = 1 - q_1$.
       \end{proposition}

       We are interested in the appearance of these structures in non-trivial cases. To this end, we need to prove the following:
       \begin{theorem}\label{theorem-q0}
            $0 < q_1 < 1$.
       \end{theorem}

       Before proving this theorem, let us define the following structures:
       \begin{definition}\label{definition_structures_restricted_game2}
            A winning structure for player 1 is said to be $41^*$-horizontal if it is a 41-horizontal structure and when viewed from left to right: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[--] Each square can only have neighbors to its right, above or bellow.
                \item[--] If a square has a neighbor above or below, the next square must be to the right.
            \end{itemize}
            % Similarly, a winning structure for player 2 is considered $40^*$-vertical if it is a 40-vertical structure and when viewed from top to bottom: each square can only have neighbors below, to its left, or to its right; if a square has a neighbor to the left or right, the next square must always be bellow.
        \end{definition}
        \noindent Let us further define the event of its existence as $H_{41}^*$, and $q^*_1$ as its critical probability.

        What we aim to achieve with this definition is to consider only 41-horizontal structures that are oriented in such a way that they can be traversed without retracing steps or encountering squares without lateral neighbors. In other words, we are defining structures that resemble the one shown in Figure \ref{fig_portion_winning_structure_player1_game2}, but not the one depicted in Remark \ref{remark_structures_restricted_game2}.

       We have the following relation:
       \[
            H_{41}^* \subset H_{41}.
       \]
       Therefore, $q_1 \leq q_1^*$, and hence, to prove the second inequality of Theorem \ref{theorem-q0}, it is sufficient to show $q_1^* < 1$. Moreover, by the relation in Proposition \ref{proposition-relation-q0-q1} and since $p \mapsto v_p$ is non-decreasing (see Remark \ref{remark_v_p_non_decreasing}), we have
       \begin{eqnarray*}
            q_1 < 1 \text{ and } q_0 \leq q_1 & \implies & q_0 < 1, \\
            q_0 < 1 \text{ and } q_1 = 1 - q_0  & \implies & q_1 > 0.  
       \end{eqnarray*}
        Finally, for proving Theorem \ref{theorem-q0} is enough to prove $q_1^* < 1$. 

        \begin{proof}
            For this, we use again a \emph{Peierls-type argument}. 

            % The Peierls argument, originally developed by physicist Rudolf Peierls for the 2D Ising model, has proved to be a powerful technique in statistical mechanics and percolation theory for establishing bounds on critical parameters and proving the existence of phase transitions, particularly in low-dimensional systems. 

            We refer to a face-square simply as a square and a 1-square denotes a square where all four surrounding edges are equal to 1. The length of a structure is defined as the number of squares it contains, and the distance between two squares is measured as the distance between their centers. 

            Let each square be associated with its center, and define a center as open if and only if the corresponding square is a 1-square. As in game 1, the problem of finding a path in this percolation setting --where paths consists of squares with edges that can be either open or closed-- translates into finding a path in a 1-independent site percolation model. In the following, we will use the terms squares and sites in the dual lattice interchangeably.

            Consider the dual lattice $(\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}^2, \tilde{\mathbb{E}}^2)$, constructed by assigning a vertex to each square of the original lattice and an edge between any two sites whose corresponding squares share an edge or a corner. The cost of sites in the dual lattice is determined by the state of the corresponding squares in the original lattice, as described in the previous paragraph. A dual path is defined as a sequence of vertices in the dual lattice, were each step allows for 8 possible moves (analogous to the moves of a king in a chessboard).

            \begin{figure}[!hbt]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width = 0.4\textwidth]{../images/game2/pierles-type-argument.jpg}
            \end{figure}

            The crucial observation is: if there is no $41^*$-horizontal structure containing the origin, there must exist an $n \in \N_+$ such that the square $[-n, n] \times [-n, n]$ is crossed vertically by a closed dual path. The previous diagram attempts to visualize this argument. The upward (or downward) dual path (represented by dark blue) is the one that `surrounds' the `tails' of the 1-square-component of the origin, preventing it from `escaping' to infinity in rightward direction.

            Another important observation is: if there is no $41^*$-horizontal, then the origin cannot be contained within one. Thus there cannot be an infinite induced path starting at 0 in the subgraph consisting of open edges.

            Using all this, the union bound, Markov inequality and the fact that a dual path from $[-n, n] \times \{n\}$ to $[-n, n] \times \{-n\}$ must have at least $2n$ edges, we obtain
                \begin{eqnarray} \notag
                   \Pbb_p(H_{41}^{*c}) & \leq & \sum_{n \geq 1} \Pbb_p\left(\substack{\text{there exist a closed dual path from}\\ [-n, n] \times \{n\} \text{ to } [-n, n] \times \{-n\}}\right) \\ \notag
                               & \leq & \sum_{n \geq 1} \E_p\left(\substack{\text{number of closed dual paths from} \\ [-n, n] \times \{n\} \text{ to } [-n, n] \times \{-n\}}\right) \\ \label{probdualpathsareclosed}
                               & \leq & \sum_{n \geq 1} n^2 \sum_{l \geq 2n} \kappa(l) \Pbb_p\left(\substack{\text{all sites of a given dual path} \\ \text{of length $l$ are closed}}\right),
                \end{eqnarray}   
            where $n^2$ accounts for the number of possible starting sites of the dual path and $\kappa(l) := \#\{\text{dual paths of length } l \text{ starting from a given square}\}$.

            Next, we provide an upper bound expression for $\kappa(l)$, which yields the bound $4^{l+2}$. 

            First, observe that traveling in one of the diagonal directions can always substitute a `corner' configuration (i.e., right then up, or left then up, or vice versa). Additionally, going in the left diagonal direction once and then right, or in the right diagonal direction once and then left (and vice versa in both situations), can be substituted by going up.

            Since we are counting the upward dual paths starting from a given fixed site (or square), we have $\kappa(1) = 1$. For $l = 2$, there are 5 possibilities: after fixing the first square, the second square can be placed in 5 different positions relative to it: above, to the right, to the left, right-up, or left-up. The last two account for the two diagonals going in the upward direction. Following this reasoning and recalling the previous observation, we obtain the following:
            \[
                \kappa(l) \leq 15\kappa(l - 2),\; \text{  for $l \geq 3$, }
            \] 
            where the term accounts for placing the second square above (which then has only 3 possibilities for the third), to the right (which has only 2 possibilities), to the left (which has also 2 possibilities), or to the left-up or right-up (which has 4 possibilities).

            Now, let $\tilde{\alpha}$ be the given oriented dual path of length $l$. For any square in $\tilde{\alpha}$, there are at most two squares in the path that share an edge with it. According to the previous analysis used to reduce the types of dual paths we are looking for, this can only happen in horizontal or vertical sequences of sites. Hence, there exists a sub-path $\tilde{\beta}$ consisting of at least $l/2$ squares from $\tilde{\alpha}$ such that any two squares $x, y \in \tilde{\beta}$ are at a distance greater than 1. Between these paths, $\tilde{\alpha}$ and $\tilde{\beta}$, the following relation holds:
            $$
                \Pbb_p(\text{every square in } \tilde{\alpha} \text{ is not a 1-square}) \leq \Pbb_p(\text{every square in } \tilde{\beta} \text{ is not a 1-square}).
            $$ 
            Moreover, since the costs of the squares of $\tilde{\beta}$ are independent, we get
            \[
                \Pbb_p(\text{every square in } \tilde{\alpha} \text{ is not a 1-square}) \leq (1 - p^4)^{|\tilde{\beta}|} \leq (1 - p^4)^{l/2}. 
            \]

            Consequently, 
            \[
                \Pbb_p(H_{41}^{*c}) \leq \sum_{n \geq 1} n^2\sum_{l \geq 2n}  4^{l+2} (1 - p^4)^{l/2} \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty \text{ for } p \text{ sufficiently large}.
            \]

            Hence, for $p$ in the interval $((15/16)^{1/4}, 1)$, we have
            \[
                \Pbb_p(H_{41}^{*c}) < 1, \text{ and thus } \Pbb_p(H_{41}^*) > 0.
            \] 
            Since the event $H_{41}^*$ is translation invariant, we can conclude that $q _1^* \leq \frac{\sqrt[4]{15}}{2}\approx 0.98 < 1$.

        \end{proof}

        We finally claim the following conjecture. 
        \begin{conjecture}\label{conjecture-v0-q0}
           $v_p = 1$ if and only if $p \geq q_1$, and $v_p = 0$ if and only if $p \leq q_0$.
        \end{conjecture}
        The same comments as for Conjecture \ref{conjecture-v0-p0} apply here. However, it is worth noting that the winning structures in this game appear simpler than the winning structures for player 1 in Game 1. Consequently, we expect that the proofs may be simpler.

        % For this game, we could think that these are the only two key points or phase transitions for the game's value. 
        In the next section we will see, with the help of computational methods, how the value function of this game has more than 2 phase transitions.

    \subsection{Computational findings}
        % For both games, we also consider to approximate the critical probability tresholds of all the relevant structures by simulating the games. The algorithm that we use for estimate the expected value fot the limit value of the game is quite slow but one possible future research direction could be to develop it optimally.

        We simulated both games to estimate the expected value of $v_n$ as a function of $p$ for each game, with $n$ as large as our computers could handle. This section aims to briefly describe the computational methods employed for these simulations and discuss the results obtained. We begin by presenting the results for Game 2, as they provide significant new insights into the behavior of its limit value. For Game 1, although we know more about it, it was still valuable to approximate the value of $p_0$ and observe how the value of $p$ behaves between $p_0$ and $p_1$. 
        
        All the computer programs used are being prepared for upload to a public repository. We decided not to include them in the report due to their length. In the meantime, you can contact me\footnote{At the email address melgonzalez073@gmail.com}. We will be happy to share them with you and discuss them, if needed.

        To estimate the expected value of $v_n$ as a function of $p$, we followed the approach: We fixed a finite two-dimensional lattice and a sequence of 200 equally spaced $p$ values within the interval $(0, 1)$. For each $p$, we ran 30 simulations with independent and identically distributed realizations of the costs on the edges. For each fixed realization, we computed the value of the largest finite stage game starting at the center of the finite lattice and constrained within its boundaries, using a recursive method.
        
        \subsubsection*{Game 2}
        Let $\mathcal{L} := [-N..N] \times [-N..N]$ be the finite square portion of $\Z^2$ centered at $0$, and let $(C_{i, j, a, b})$, where $(i, j, a, b) \in \mathcal{L} \times \{ (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)\}$, denote the payoff of the edge between $(i, j)$ and $(i + a, j + b)$. 

        For a fixed $p$ in $(0, 1)$, we generate the costs by independently assigning a cost of 1 to each edge of $\mathcal{L}$ with probability $p$. For each fixed realization of the costs, determining the optimal strategy for the players in the $n$-stage game can be approached recursively, as well as the computation of the value.

        Suppose we are at stage $n$ and player 1 has already played, moving the token to $(i', j')$. Player 2 is now deciding what to play. Player 2's choice depends on the value of the $(n-1)$-stage games starting at positions $(i'+ 1, j')$ and $(i'-1, j')$. If player 2 moves right, the cost will be
        \begin{equation}\label{player2-right}
            C_{i, j', 1, 0} + v_{n-1}(i'+1, j'),
        \end{equation}
        whereas if player 2 moves left, the cost will be 
        \begin{equation}\label{player2-left}
            C_{i, j', -1, 0} + v_{n-1}(i'-1, j').
        \end{equation}
        Hence, he will choose the minimum between these 2 expressions. 

        Now, consider being at position $(i, j)$ at stage $n$ in player 1's turn. If player 1 moves up, he will receive the cost of the edge from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j + 1)$ plus the minimum between \eqref{player2-right} and \eqref{player2-left} with $(i', j') = (i, j+1)$. A similar analysis applies if player 1 moves down. Therefore, the value of the $n$-stage game starting at $(i, j)$ can be computed using the recursion: 
        \begin{align*}   
            v_n(i, j) = & \max (C_{i, j, 0, 1} + \min (C_{i, j+1, 1, 0} + v_{n-1}(i+1, j+1), C_{i, j+1, -1, 0} + v_{n-1}(i-1, j+1)), \\
                        & C_{i, j, 0, -1} + \min (C_{i, j-1, 1, 0} + v_{n-1}(i+1, j-1), C_{i, j-1, -1, 0} + v_{n-1}(i-1, j-1))).
        \end{align*}

        The initialization of this recursion should be done on the boundaries since as you move deeper into the lattice, you can play more stages. When starting at $(i, j)$, it is only meaningful to consider games up to $N - \max(\lvert i\rvert , \lvert j\rvert )$ stages. If you attempt to play more than this, the token may reach a point where not all 4 moves are available.

        From the simulations, we obtain the graphs in Figure \ref{figurepNgame2}.

        They are quite striking, showing that the value function almost stabilizes at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 for intervals determined by probability thresholds, indicated by the red and green points. This suggests the occurrence of eight phase transitions.

        Let define $r_{x}$ and $r'_{x}$ for $x \in \{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\}$ as the probability thresholds between which $v_p$ is almost surely equal to $x$, i.e.,
        \begin{equation*}
            r_x := \inf\{p \in [0, 1] \colon \Pbb_p(v_p =  x) = 1\}, \; \text{and} \; r_x' := \inf\{p \in [0, 1] \colon \Pbb_p(v_p > x) = 1\}.
        \end{equation*}
       By the one-to-one correspondence between the players' winning structures, and therefore between their strategies, we should have $r_x = 1 - r_{1-x}'$ for all $x \in \{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\}$. Thus, from now on, everything discussed will be with respect to the $r_x$'s.
        
        It is expected that these thresholds correspond to the critical probabilities for some specific structures. In particular, we should have the following.

        \begin{conjecture}\label{conjecture_q1_r1}
            $r_1 = q_1$.
        \end{conjecture}

        Indeed, since the function $p \mapsto v_p$ is non-decreasing, we have, in particular,
        $$
            q_1 = \sup \{p \in [0, 1] \colon \Pbb_p(H_{41}) < 1\}.
        $$ 
        On the other hand, from Conjecture \ref{conjecture-v0-q0} we would have
        $$
            q_1 = \inf \{p \in [0, 1] \colon \Pbb_p(v_p = 1) = 1\}.
        $$
        
        Let us define $km$-horizontal structures for $k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $m \in \{0, 1\}$ as those satisfying the conditions of Proposition \ref{rigtht-structure-player1-game2}, where all the squares composing them have $k$ or more $m$'s. We denote their event of existence as $H_{k1}$.  In particular, a square with 2 ones in a $21$-structure can take one of the following forms:

                \end{align}  
        \end{conjecture}
        
        This conjecture states that $v_p \geq x$  if and only if a  $k1$-structure with $k \geq 4x$ appears; that is, if a winning structure for player 1 with squares having \( 4x \) or more 1s emerges. Specifically, $v_p \geq 0.25$ if and only if the number of 1s in each square of the winning structure is 1 or more. 

        Returning to Figure \ref{figurepNgame2}, one possible interpretation of the graphs based on this conjecture is as follows: From $r_0$ to $r_0'$, player 1 cannot achieve more than zero, as for $p < r_0'$, player 2 guarantees a winning structure filled with 0s. After $r_0'$ and up to $r_{0.25}$, player 1 will try to find structures with as many 1s as possible, which explains the increase up to $r_{0.25}$. Beyond $r_{0.25}$ and up to $r_{0.25}'$, the value no longer increases because, once again, for $p < r_{0.25}'$, player 2 ensures a winning structure with squares having 3 or more 0s (or having 1 or fewer 1s). This pattern continues through the analysis up to $r_1'$. Hence, player 1 consistently strives to obtain more 1s, but at certain points, player 2 halts his progress, forcing player 1 to settle for fixed values.

        In an effort to test these conjectures, we computationally investigated the critical probability of the appearance of winning structures containing $k$ or more 1s. Instead of studying the percolation probability for the events $H_{k1}$, we considered the events $H_{k1}^*$, as defined in the previous section (see Definition \ref{definition_structures_restricted_game2} and the subsequent analysis). We chose this approach not only because it simplified the computational analysis but also because we believe these structures are either the relevant ones or very close to them. In the following, we refer to a $k$-square as a square with $k$ or more 1s.

        In this phase of the analysis, the game is no longer considered. Instead, we focus on the percolation model on the square lattice $\Z^2$ and aim to identify a connected graph of $k$-squares that meets the conditions of Definition \ref{definition_structures_restricted_game2} and spans the lattice from the left side to the right side, thereby estimating the right-hand sides of the equations in Conjectures \ref{conjecture-r-q} and \ref{conjecture_q1_r1}. From now on, we refer to connected graphs as clusters.

        We utilized a modified version of the Newman-Ziff algorithm, as proposed by Newman and Ziff \cite{NewmanZiff2001}, which allows us to measure observable quantities (e.g., average cluster size, largest cluster size, or cluster spanning) in a percolation system across all values of site or bond open probability, from zero to one. The algorithm, described here in terms of bond percolation, is based on a simple yet powerful idea: creating a set of percolation configurations by opening bonds one by one, starting from a lattice with all bonds initially closed. Additionally, the clusters on the lattice change minimally when a single bond is opened, enabling the computation of new clusters from the old ones with relatively little computational effort. To track the cluster configuration of the lattice, the algorithm employs a method called union-find, which efficiently performs the following operations: when a bond is opened, it finds which clusters the sites at either end belong to; if the sites belong to different clusters, those clusters are unified into a single cluster. If the sites are already in the same cluster, no action is performed.

        Originally developed to handle (non-oriented) site or bond percolation, the algorithm had to be adapted for our study to manage paths formed by $k$-squares that meet the conditions specified in Definition \ref{definition_structures_restricted_game2}. Briefly, we start with a lattice $\mathcal{L}$ with a fixed $N$ in which all bonds are closed. We then proceed as follows: First, we determine an order for opening the bonds by choosing a random permutation of them. With this order established, we open the bonds one by one accordingly. As bonds are opened, new clusters of single $k$-square are created, or existing clusters of $k$-squares are merged into larger ones, or nothing interesting happens, as some opened bonds may connect pairs of squares that are already in the same cluster. This process continues until all bonds on the lattice are opened. At each step, we check if a new $k$-square has been created, and if so, we verify the existence of a connected graph of squares that meets the definition. We perform this check using a combination of a union-find algorithm and a depth-first search. If such a cluster is found, we record the onset of percolation for that step, which corresponds to the mean number of open bonds. Finally, we ran 30 simulations of this procedure and averaged the results to obtain the mean onset of percolation.

        The graphs in Figures \ref{figure-k1}-\ref{figure-k4} display the critical probability as a function of $N$ for four values of $k\colon 1, 2, 3$ and 4, along with their mean represented by a horizontal dashed line. The data was obtained from this algorithm for a sequence of 50 equally spaced $N$ values within the interval [20, 100].

        We observe that the range of values for each $k$ aligns quite well with the values of the red points in the graphs in Figure \ref{figurepNgame2}, which represent estimates of $r_{k/4}$ from the game simulations. We could say that, they could be slightly higher, but this does not contradict the conjecture, as the points that determine these intervals correspond to onset percolation probabilities of the events $H_{k1}^*$, which, as the analysis in the previous section shows, should be greater than those for the corresponding events $H_{k1}$.

        \subsubsection*{Game 1}
        Let $\mathcal{L} := [-N..N] \times [-N..N]$ be the finite square portion of $\Z_r^2$, centered at $0$, and $(C_{i, j, a, b})$, $(i, j, a, b) \in \mathcal{L} \times \{(1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)\}$ the payoff of the edge between $(i, j)$ and $(i + a, j + b)$. For a given $p$ in $(0, 1)$ and a fixed realization of the costs, the recursion for calculating the $n$-stage value of this game is
        \begin{align*}   
            v_n(i, j) =  \min (& \max (C_{i, j, 1, 1} + v_{n-1}(i+1, j+1), C_{i, j, -1, 1} + v_{n-1}(i-1, j+1)), \\
                               & \max (C_{i, j, 1, -1} + v_{n-1}(i+1, j-1), C_{i, j, -1, -1} + v_{n-1}(i-1, j-1))).
        \end{align*}

        % To generate the graph of $v_n(p)$ as a function of $p$, as for game 2, we considered 200 equally spaced $p$ values in $(0, 1)$ and for each $p$, we ran 30 simulations.

            \caption{For Game 1, $v_{n}$ is plotted as a function of $p$ for $n = 125, 250$ and $500$. The values at which $v_{n}$ stabilizes are 0 and 1.}

        \end{figure} 

        The simulations suggest that between $p_0$ and $p_1$, the value almost stabilizes again, though for a very short time, in the values $0.25$ and $0.5$. This behavior might again be related to the distribution of 0s and 1s in the squares, which could contain the winning structures for player 1. They also indicate that $0.15 < p_0 < 0.2$ and that $p_0$ converges to a value close to $0.185$. Furthermore, they suggest that the value function is continuous everywhere.

        To further investigate whether the limit value exists without the orientation assumption, the next section explores a generalization of the Percolation Games model by incorporating random noise into the game's transition function.
