# Project abstract

Percolation games are a class of zero-sum stochastic games in which a token moves across $\mathbb{Z}^d$ based on a transition function jointly controlled by both players, with random, spatially distributed payoffs. When the payoffs are i.i.d. in space and the game is oriented -meaning the token tends to move in a fixed direction regardless of the players' actions- the value of the $n$-stage game has been shown to converge to a limit as $n$ tends to infinity. It remains unresolved whether this convergence occurs without the orientation assumption. During this research internship, our goal was to delve a little deeper into this question by examining specific non-oriented games. 

First, we analyze two examples on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, whose limit values turn out to be directly related to percolation through specific lattice structures that provide strategic advantages to the players. We geometrically characterize these structures, analyze the critical probabilities of their occurrence, and explore their strategic implications. We formulated several conjectures that, while strongly believed to be true, we were unable to prove conclusively. To test these conjectures and gain further insights, we conducted computational simulations for both games. This approach proved particularly valuable for the second game, where simulations significantly enhanced our understanding.

Second, we extend the percolation games model by incorporating a stochastic process into the first component of the state transitions. This modification allows the token in an oriented game to return to previously visited states. For an i.i.d. and oriented game, if the stochastic process has a mean of zero, the resulting game preserves orientation in expectation. Moreover, if it also has bounded support, we prove that the game possesses a limit value, with its expected value converging at the same rate as that of the base game, thus extending the original result.

# Codes

First, we simulated the 2 games introduced in Section 3 of the report to estimate the expected value of their $n$-stage value function as a function of $p$, with $n$ as large as our computers could handle. For it, we followed the approach: We fixed a finite two-dimensional lattice and a sequence of 200 equally spaced $p$ values within the interval $(0, 1)$. For each $p$, we ran 30 simulations with independent and identically distributed realizations of the costs on the edges. For each fixed realization, we computed the value of the largest finite stage game starting at the center of the finite lattice and constrained within its boundaries, using a recursive method.

Second, to test some conjectures, we focus on the percolation model on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and aim to identify a connected graph of squares that meets the conditions of Definition 3.21. and spans the lattice from the left side to the right side. We utilized a modified version of the Newman-Ziff algorithm, which allows us to measure observable quantities (e.g., average cluster size, largest cluster size, or cluster spanning) in a percolation system across all values of site or bond open probability, from zero to one.
